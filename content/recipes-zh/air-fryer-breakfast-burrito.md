## Make-Ahead Instructions

**For Freezing:**
1. Assemble burritos but don't cook
2. Wrap individually in foil or plastic wrap
3. Store in freezer bags for up to 3 months
4. Cook from frozen, adding 5-7 extra minutes

## Filling Variations

**Vegetarian:**
- Skip bacon, add black beans and avocado

**Southwestern:**
- Add jalapeños, corn, and black beans

**Sausage & Egg:**
- Replace bacon with breakfast sausage

**Denver Style:**
- Add ham, peppers, onions, and cheese

## Pro Tips

- **Wrap tightly**: Prevents filling from spilling out
- **Seam side down**: Keeps burrito closed during cooking
- **Don't overfill**: Makes rolling easier
- **Spray well**: Ensures golden, crispy exterior

## Perfect Sides

- Fresh fruit salad
- Home fries
- Coffee or fresh juice
- Yogurt parfait
