## Tips for Perfect Air Fryer Shrimp

- **Don't overcook**: Shrimp cooks quickly, watch carefully to avoid rubbery texture
- **Single layer**: Don't overcrowd the basket for even cooking
- **Pat dry**: Remove excess moisture for better browning

## Variations

- **Garlic Butter**: Add melted butter and minced garlic
- **Spicy**: Increase cayenne pepper or add hot sauce
- **Lemon Herb**: Add fresh herbs like dill, basil, or thyme

## Serving Ideas

- Over rice or pasta
- In tacos or wraps
- As appetizer with cocktail sauce
- In salads

## Storage

Cooked shrimp keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in air fryer at 350°F for 3-4 minutes.
