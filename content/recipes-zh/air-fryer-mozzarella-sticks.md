## Tips for Perfect Mozzarella Sticks

- **Freeze is key**: Double freezing prevents cheese from leaking
- **Don't overcrowd**: Cook in batches for even crisping
- **Watch closely**: They can go from perfect to overcooked quickly
- **Serve immediately**: Best when hot and gooey inside

## Serving Suggestions

- Marinara sauce (classic)
- Ranch dressing
- Spicy arrabbiata sauce
- Garlic aioli
- Buffalo sauce

## Make Ahead

Bread the mozzarella sticks and freeze for up to 1 month. Cook directly from frozen, adding 2-3 extra minutes.
