## Perfect Cookie Tips

- **Soften butter**: Room temperature butter creams better
- **Chill dough**: Prevents spreading and improves texture
- **Use parchment**: Makes removal easier
- **Don't overbake**: Cookies continue cooking as they cool
- **Space properly**: Give cookies room to spread

## Variations

**Double Chocolate:**
- Replace 2 tbsp flour with cocoa powder
- Use dark chocolate chips

**Oatmeal Chocolate Chip:**
- Replace 1/4 cup flour with oats
- Add 1/4 tsp cinnamon

**Peanut Butter Chocolate:**
- Add 2 tbsp peanut butter
- Reduce butter to 3 tbsp

**White Chocolate Macadamia:**

- Add 1/4 cup chopped macadamia nuts

## Storage

**Room Temperature:** 5 days in airtight container
**Refrigerator:** 1 week
**Freezer:** Freeze dough balls for up to 3 months, bake from frozen adding 2 minutes

## Make Ahead

Form cookie dough balls and freeze. Cook directly from frozen, adding 2-3 extra minutes to cooking time. Perfect for single-serve treats!
