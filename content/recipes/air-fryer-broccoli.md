- **Single layer**: Ensure even cooking by not overcrowding
- **Shake halfway**: Helps achieve even browning

## Variations

- **Spicy**: Increase red pepper flakes or add hot sauce
- **Asian Style**: Add soy sauce, sesame oil, and sesame seeds

## Serving Suggestions

- As a side dish with chicken or fish
- Over rice or quinoa
- In pasta dishes
- As a healthy snack

## Storage

Cooked broccoli keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in air fryer at 350°F for 3-4 minutes.
