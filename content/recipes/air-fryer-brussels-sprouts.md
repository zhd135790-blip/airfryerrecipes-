## Tips for Crispy Brussels Sprouts

- **Dry thoroughly**: Moisture prevents crisping
- **Cut side down**: Place cut side down first for best caramelization
- **Don't overcrowd**: Leave space for air circulation
- **Shake basket**: Ensures even cooking and crispiness

## Flavor Variations

**Honey Balsamic:**
- Mix 2 tbsp honey with 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- Drizzle over cooked sprouts

**Bacon & Maple:**
- Add cooked bacon bits
- Drizzle with maple syrup

**Asian Style:**
- Toss with soy sauce and sesame oil
- Sprinkle with sesame seeds

**Spicy:**
- Add red pepper flakes
- Drizzle with sriracha mayo

## Storage & Reheating

Store leftovers in airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in air fryer at 350°F for 5 minutes to restore crispiness.
