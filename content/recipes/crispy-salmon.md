## Cooking Tips

- **Pat dry**: Moisture prevents crispy skin
- **Don't flip**: Keep skin-side down for best results
- **Check doneness**: Salmon should flake easily at 145°F internal temperature

## Serving Suggestions

- Roasted vegetables
- Quinoa or brown rice
- Steamed broccoli
- Lemon herb sauce

## Storage

Cooked salmon keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat gently in the air fryer at 350°F for 3-4 minutes.
