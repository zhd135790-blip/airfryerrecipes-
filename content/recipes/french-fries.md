## The Secret to Crispy Fries

1. **Soak the potatoes**: This removes excess starch
2. **Dry thoroughly**: Moisture is the enemy of crispiness
3. **Don't overcrowd**: Give fries space to crisp up
4. **Shake regularly**: Ensures even cooking

## Dipping Sauce Ideas

Try these fries with:
- Classic ketchup
- Garlic aioli
- Ranch dressing
- Cheese sauce
- Spicy mayo

## Storage and Reheating

Store leftover fries in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the air fryer at 350°F for 5 minutes to restore crispiness.
