## Tips for Perfect Apple Chips

- **Slice thin**: Thinner slices = crispier chips
- **Use mandoline**: Ensures uniform thickness
- **Pat dry**: Removes excess moisture for better crisping
- **Don't overlap**: Air needs to circulate around each slice
- **Cool completely**: They crisp up more as they cool

## Best Apples for Chips

**Sweet:**
- Honeycrisp
- Fuji
- Gala

**Tart:**
- Granny Smith
- Pink Lady

**Balanced:**
- Braeburn
- Jonagold

## Flavor Variations

**Cinnamon Sugar:**
- Add 1 tsp coconut sugar with cinnamon

**Spiced:**
- Mix in ginger and cardamom

**Savory:**
- Sprinkle with sea salt only

**Caramel:**
- Light spray of caramel extract

## Storage

Store in airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. If they lose crispiness, reheat in air fryer at 300°F for 2-3 minutes.
