# Air Fryer Troubleshooting Guide

Having problems with your air fryer? This comprehensive guide will help you diagnose and fix common issues quickly.

### Is Your Air Fryer Smoking?

**White Smoke:**
- Likely cause: Excess oil or fatty foods
- Solution: Reduce oil, place bread under food to catch drips

**Black Smoke:**

- Solution: Deep clean immediately, check for damage

### Is Food Not Cooking Evenly?

**Top cooks faster than bottom:**
- Flip food halfway through cooking

**Some pieces done, others not:**
- Don't overcrowd basket, cook in batches

**Outside overcooked, inside raw:**
- Lower temperature, cook longer

## Common Problems & Solutions

- Poor air circulation

**Solutions**:
1. Cook in smaller batches

5. Arrange larger pieces on outside

**Pro Tip**: Cook same-sized items together

### 3. Food Not Crispy
